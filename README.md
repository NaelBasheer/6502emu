#6502 emulator

This is a research project done by Mohammed 'Tanjoodo' Arabiat and Nael 'NaelBasheer' Albasheer. It is an emulator to the very popular 6502 CPU.

This specific version is very limited in terms of utility but should provide a solid base for any application of 6502 emulation for beginners.

##Features

This emulator can theoretically emulate all documented 6502 instructions in a predictable fashion. 
It is also written in a very extensible way so it can be augmented by other facilities.


##Resources used in making this

We have made use of the incredible http://nesdev.com/6502.txt document as well as http://www.llx.com/~nparker/a2/opcodes.html to understand how the processor works. The official programming manual and hardware manual have been incredible help as well.
